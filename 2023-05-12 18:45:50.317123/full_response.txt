TEXT:
Once upon a time, in a far-off kingdom, there lived four brothers named Peter, Paul, Tom, and Harry. They were always up for some adventure and were known for their bravery. One day, they found themselves on a deserted island, where they stumbled upon none other than Spongebob Squarepants!

Spongebob was not quite his usual self. He had turned into a monster and was causing a lot of chaos on the island. The brothers knew they had to do something to save the day. Peter and Paul took charge, formulating a plan to take down Spongebob. Tom and Harry were skeptical but followed along.

The brothers went after Spongebob, who was using his tentacles to destroy everything in sight. Peter and Paul tried to distract Spongebob while Tom and Harry snuck up behind him. But Spongebob was too fast and managed to fling them both away with his tentacles. It all seemed hopeless, but the brothers refused to give up.

They regrouped and came up with a new plan. Peter and Tom would take on Spongebob's tentacles while Paul and Harry attacked him from the front. This time, they were more successful. They managed to tire Spongebob out, and finally, they were able to defeat the monster.

The brothers had saved the day and were hailed as heroes. Spongebob, back to his usual happy self, thanked them for freeing him from his monster form. The four brothers returned home, their bravery and heroism celebrated by all.
